        <p>These soft-boiled, marinated eggs are perfect to add to your ramen soup. </p>
        <p>I was given this recipe by the owner of a great little ramen shop I stopped at for lunch one day.</p>
        <p>The eggs turn out beautifully every time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients and instructions</h2>  
        <h3>Marinade:</h3>
        <p>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cooking sake</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Additionally:</h3>
        <p>
            <li>4 Eggs</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Bring eggs to room temperature by soaking them in warm water for about 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a low boil.</p>
            </li>

            <li>    
                <p>Carefully pierce the bottom of each egg with thumb tack. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Gently lower eggs into water and boil for 6 minutes 20 seconds. Remove eggs and place in a bowl of ice water until completely cool, about 2 minutes.
            </p></li>

            <li>
                <p>While the eggs are cooling, stir together soy sauce, mirin, sake, and pepper for marinade in a bowl.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Carefully peel cooled eggs; try to start from the middle of the shell and work you way up and down.
            </p></li>

            <li><p>Place whole peeled eggs in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 to 4 hours, or up to 2 days for stronger flavor, turning eggs every 30 minutes or as often as you prefer.            </p></li>
        
            <li>Slice eggs in half when ready to use.</li>
        </ol>

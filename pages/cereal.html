        <p>This recipe is a fresh take on the traditional breakfast meal. It was inspired by the
            nessesity of having at least more than a single recipe so that I could call it a "cookbook".
            I have seen quite a bit of cereal tomfoolery in my time and I wanted to set the reccord
            straight on how it should be made. 'Gormet' is obviously a facecious misnomer but it should
            be better known that there are more than one way to pour a bowl.

        <h2 class="center">Ingredients and Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <li>Your choice of cereal</li>
            <li>Your choice of dried or frozen berries and fruits</li>
            <li>Marshmallows (smaller works better, but some may wish to opt for the more 'cost effective' large
                mallows)</li>
            <li>A quarter cup of nuts should be added. Walnuts are my personal favorite but any should work.</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Wet Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully pour the solids into an appropirately sized cereal bowl (extra care should be taken to avoid
                mess, this is 'gormet' after all!</li>
            <li>Liquids should be added seccond. The pour height should be <strong>minimized</strong> as much as
                possible to avoid a catistrophic reflection based event</li>
            <li>Marshmallow and walnut garnishes should be added to the mixture last. Work with haste however, every
                wasted moment allows millk to soak into the flakes. Time is of the essence!</li>
            <li>Take a moment to appreciate your work of art before you indiscriminately eat away. Good work!</li>
        </ol>

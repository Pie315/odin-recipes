        <p>This page was created for the Odin-Project 'recipies' assignment. This assignment encompasses the bare essentials of making a webpage 
            using HTML, as well as getting used to Git and GitHub. It should serve as a building platform that I can learn other languages such as CSS and JS. 
            All of the files are uploaded using Git and <a href="https://github.com/Pie315/odin-recipes">GitHub</a>. I yoinked the 
            ramen noodle picture from the internet (as well as the recipe that goes with it). However, the 'gormet cereal' was my own creation.
            The picture accompanying that page is my own. After a late night of playing Risk with my friends, I groggily poured my cereal into
            a bowl, and evidently the table it was on. I snapped the picture and sent it to a friend with the following text "It's 2am and already 
            a terrible day". The icons of food were both created with Dall-E 2.0 using a text prompt. The icon of soup turned out much better than 
            the cereal. Using AI generated pictures is, and will be a massive time saver when making proof of concepts like this because it removes
            the complexity of making custom pictures for all of my projects while also maintaing a similar ammount of origionality to the project itself. 
            I'm running out of things to say at this point but the page looks <strong>much</strong> better when it's filled with text. Lorem ipsum dolor sit,
